# NestJS Business Card Site Builder (with Auth)

This project is a backend service built with **NestJS** that allows **authenticated users** to create and manage their own single-page "business card" websites.

The primary goal of the service is to provide a platform where any user can quickly generate pages for their products or services, upload photos, and receive orders directly to their email.

## ðŸš€ Project Description

The service provides a secure API for creating, updating, and deleting "business card sites." Each user only has access to the sites they have created.

The service implements:
1.  **Authentication**: User registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
2.  **Site Management**: Full CRUD for sites, linked to a specific user.
3.  **File Uploads**: Ability to upload photos for sites directly to the server.
4.  **Order Form**: A public form on each site that sends order details to the site owner's email (or a pre-configured email).

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **User Authentication**:
    * Registration (Email/Password).
    * Login and receiving an `access_token`.
* **Privacy**: All site management endpoints (`/sites`) are protected (require a JWT token). A user cannot see or edit another user's sites.
* **Business Card Site Creation**:
    * Title, Price, Description 1, Description 2.
    * Choice of one of three design templates.
* **Photo Uploads**: Uploading images (using `multipart/form-data`) when creating or updating a site.
* **Order Form**: Collection of minimal information (Name, Phone, Address, Quantity, Comment) and sending it via Email.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **Backend**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
* **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* **Authentication**: [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/) (with `JwtStrategy` and `LocalStrategy`)
* **File Uploads**: [Multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) (for handling `multipart/form-data`)
* **Email**: [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) (or `@nestjs-modules/mailer`)
* **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* **ODM**: [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) (via `@nestjs/mongoose`)
